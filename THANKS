I'd like to thank Timothy Mann for maintaing the xtrs emulator, the codebase
of which helped me better understand certain aspects of the machine, and from
which I copied and adapted the cassette interface and the character generator
fonts.

You can find the emulator here: http://www.tim-mann.org/xtrs.html
